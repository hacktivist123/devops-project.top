This is a real-world DevOps project with no Kubernetes. The idea is to build a Linux based infrastructure with cheap and open source tools.

Tools involved:
- [Linode](linode.com) VPS with additional storage
- Arch Linux as the OS of the server
- Ansible
- Certbot
- WireGuard
- Docker
- MariaDB
- LXC (Linux Container)
- iRedMail
- Zulip
- Traefik
- Pi-Hole
- Nextcloud
- checkmk
- Borg & Borgmatic
- Gitlab
- Go
